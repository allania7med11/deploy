    #   To connect from the Semaphore container to the Vagrant machine:
    #    - Copy the Vagrant-generated private key from:
    #        .vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/private_key
    #    - To: ansible/.ssh/local/private_key
    #    - The Semaphore image build or runtime setup will mount ansible/.ssh
    #      to /home/semaphore/.ssh inside the container for seamless SSH access.
